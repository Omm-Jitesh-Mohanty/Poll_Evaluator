<h1>Introduction:</h1>
We will create a pollster (voting system) web application using Django. This application will conduct a series of questions along with many choices. A user will be allowed to vote for that question by selecting a choice. Based on the answer the total votes will be calculated and it will be displayed to the user. Users can also check the result of the total votes for specific questions on the website directly. We will also build the admin part of this project. Admin user will be allowed to add questions and manage questions in the application. 

<h1>Pre-requisite:</h1> 
Knowledge of Python and basics of Django Framework. Python should be installed in the system. Visual studio code or any code editor to work on the application. 

<h1>Technologies used in the project:</h1>
Django framework and SQLite database which comes by default with Django. 

<h1>Functions</h1>
Here I have created a superuser.The superuser only have ability to create poll and normal user can only vote.It is just like our election commission can set our EVM for us.The user can go and vote his party.As it has capacity to calculate result instantly so it can publish result very fast.And also superuser can stop poll anytime like when election time go no one can vote.I want certain more development on it like user can only login by using his voterid and password and also that result will publish when election commision want and it congratulate to all.
